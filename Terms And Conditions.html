                continue to be billed
                to the Payment Method you provided until canceled. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in
                order to avoid
                billing of the next month’s subscription fee to the Payment Method you provided. Refunds cannot be
                claimed for any

                provided to

                13.9 ENTIRE AGREEMENT
            </h4>
            <p>
                These Terms and any document expressly referred to in them constitute the whole agreement between us and
                supersede all
                previous discussions, correspondence, negotiations, previous arrangement, understanding or agreement
                between us relating
                to their subject matter. We each acknowledge that neither of us relies on, or will have any remedies in
                respect of, any
                representation or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these Terms
                or the documents
                referred to in them. Each of us agrees that our only liability in respect of those representations and
                warranties that
                are set out in this agreement (whether made innocently or negligently) will be for breach of contract.
                Nothing in this
                section limits or excludes any liability for fraud.

                (a) We will use reasonable endeavors to remedy faults in the Products. If we fail to comply with these

                (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you assume full responsibility for your own use of the

            </h4>
            <p>
                DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND BINDING ARBITRATION PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY, AS THEY
                REQUIRE YOU TO
                ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH apps2feelgood, AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM
                apps2feelgood, INCLUDING A
                LIMITATION ON THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS
                ACTION OR
                REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM.
            </p>
            <p>
                (a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. All disputes arising out of, relating to, or in connection
                with these Terms
                or your use of the Products that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court will be resolved
                through binding
                arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and apps2feelgood are not required to arbitrate any
                dispute in which
                either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names,
                logos, trade
                secrets, or patents.
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
                dispute-resolution
                provision. Arbitration will be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). If the
                AAA is not
                available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. The rules of the arbitral
                forum will
                govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The
                AAA Consumer
                Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at <a
                    href="www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at
                1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator.
                If the claim is for $10,000 or less, the party initiating the arbitration may choose whether the
                arbitration will be
                conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance
                based
                telephonic hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county of your
                billing
                address. In the case of an in-person hearing, the proceedings will be conducted at a location which is
                reasonably
                convenient for both parties with due consideration of the ability to travel and other pertinent
                circumstances. If the
                parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by the arbitration
                institution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation will be limited to those fees set forth
                in the AAA Rules
                with the remainder paid by apps2feelgood. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
                claim or the relief
                sought in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards
                set forth in
                Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
                In such case, you agree to reimburse
                apps2feelgood for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under
                the AAA Rules.
                Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned
                written decision
                sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any,
                are based. The
                arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses
                at any time
                during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling
                on the merits.
            </p>
            <p>
                (c) Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to decide the jurisdiction of
                the arbitrator,
                including any unconscionable challenge or other challenge that the arbitration provision or the
                Agreement is void,
                voidable, or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator shall also have the exclusive authority to determine the
                rights and
                liabilities, if any, of you and apps2feelgood. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other
                matters or joined
                with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of
                all or part of
                any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award all remedies available under
                applicable law, the
                arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an
                individual basis that
                a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and
                apps2feelgood.
            </p>
            <p>
                (d) Jury Trial Waiver. Except where not permitted by law, you and Headspace waive any constitutional and
                statutory
                rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury. Rather, you and apps2feelgood
                elect to have claims
                and disputes resolved by arbitration. In any litigation between you and apps2feelgood over whether to
                vacate or enforce
                an arbitration award, you and apps2feelgood waive all rights to a jury trial, and elect instead to have
                the dispute be
                resolved by a judge.
            </p>
            <p>
                (e) Class Action Waiver. WHERE PERMITTED UNDER THE APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND APPS2FEELGOOD AGREE THAT EACH
                MAY BRING
                CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER
                IN ANY PURPORTED
                CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed
                invalid or
                unenforceable, neither you nor apps2feelgood are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and
                disputes will be
                resolved in a court as set forth in section 13.13 below.
            </p>
            <p>
                (f) Opt-out. YOU MAY OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. If you do so, neither you nor apps2feelgood
                can force the
                other to arbitrate. To opt-out, you must notify apps2feelgood in writing no later than 30 days after
                first becoming
                subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, and the email
                address you used to
                set up your apps2feelgood account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to
                opt-out of this
                arbitration agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to one of the following email addresses:
                customer_support@affirmationapps.com
            </p>
            <p>
                (g) Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or apps2feelgood may bring an
                individual action in
                small claims court.
            </p>
            <p>
                (h) Public Injunction Exclusion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may pursue a claim for public
                injunctive relief
                either in court or through arbitration.
            </p>
            <p>
                (i) Arbitration Agreement Survival. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your
                relationship with
                apps2feelgood.

                13.13 EXCLUSIVE VENUE
            </h4>
            <p>
                To the extent the parties are permitted under these Terms to initiate litigation in a court, both you
                and apps2feelgood
                agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to the Terms or the use of the Products
                will be litigated
                exclusively in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. If, however,
                that court would
                lack original jurisdiction over the litigation, then all claims and disputes arising out of or relating
                to the Terms or
                the use of the Products will be litigated exclusively in the Superior Court of California, County of Los
                Angeles. You
                and apps2feelgood consent to the personal jurisdiction of both courts.
            </p>

                13.14 CHOICE OF LAW
            </h4>
            <p>
                Except to the extent they are preempted by U.S. federal law, the laws of California, other than its
                conflict-of-laws
                principles, govern these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or their
                subject matter,
                including tort claims.
            </p>

                13.15 SEVERABILITY
            </h4>
            <p>
                If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, then that provision will be severed from these
                Terms and not
                affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
                These Terms are effective and were last updated on August 19, 2022.
