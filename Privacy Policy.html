                The security of your personal data is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect
                the personal
                data submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If you have any questions about
                the security of
                your personal data, you can contact us at Customer_Support@affirmationapps.com. Except as described
                under the

                apps2feelgood maintains technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to help protect the security
                of your personal
                information against unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, misuse or disclosure. Your

                duties. Please
                note, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100%

            </h3>
            <p>
                If you sign up to receive promotional materials from us via email, text, and/or push notifications we
                will use the data
                you give us to provide the communications you have requested. If you inform us that you wish to cancel

                directly or through a
                third-party for the specific purpose of receiving an SMS message with a link to our Apps, you will

                5. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
            </h3>
            <p>
                apps2feelgood and our analytics partners use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to
                enable a
                service to recognize your device so you don't have to provide the same data several times during one
                task, to recognize
                that you may have already given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page
                requested, and to
                measure how people are using the Products.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content data and preferences. Third parties with whom we
                partner to
                provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store data. Various browsers may
                offer their own
                management tools for removing HTML5.
            </p>
            <p>
                We partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our advertising of the Products on
                other sites or
                platforms as well as across your other devices based on your past visits to our Website. Our third party
                partners may
                use technologies such as cookies to gather data about your activities within the Products to deliver
                such advertising to
                you, such as retargeting ads. We do not respond to do-not-track signals. You may continue to receive
                generic ads on
                these third party platforms. You may also opt out of receiving ads across devices by adjusting your ad
                preference in
                your Google account.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use third party trackers to let us know when users have visited the Products by “clicking-through”
                our sponsored
                advertising or content hosted on third party platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Products use Google Analytics code to gather statistical data. Google Analytics sets cookies to help
                us accurately
                estimate the number of visitors to the Products and the volumes of usage of the Products. This is done
                to ensure that
                the Products are available when you want them and are fast. For more data on how Google Analytics
                processes this data,
                visit <a href="www.google.com/analytics">www.google.com/analytics</a>.
                We will acquire consent from you in order to use such trackers or provide you with the opportunity to
                opt-out of such
                trackers, to the extent required by applicable law.

                We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile
                software on your
                phone. This software may record data such as how often you engage with the Products, the events that
                occur within the
                Products, aggregated usage and performance data, and where the Applications were downloaded from. We may

                As is true of most websites, we gather certain data and automatically store it in log files. This data
                may include
                Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
                operating system,
                date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. These and the open statistics are used in aggregate form to
                give us an
                indication of the popularity of the content and to help us make decisions about future content and
                formatting.

            </h3>
            <p>
                All data you provide to us through the Products is stored on our secure servers located in the US. Any
                payment
                transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology; all payment data is stored with our payment
                processor and is never
                stored on apps2feelgood’s servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, which
                enables you to
                access certain parts of the Products, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask
                you not to
                share a password with anyone, and suggest that you change your password frequently.
                Unfortunately, the transmission of data via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do
                our best to
                protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Products;
                any transmission
                is at your own risk. Once we have received your data, we will use strict procedures and security
                features to try to
                prevent unauthorized access.

            </h3>
            <p>
                apps2feelgood is also offered through partnerships with organizations. Sometimes corporations,
                governments, hospitals,
                universities and other organizations and groups (“Partner(s)”) wish to make apps2feelgood available to
                their members,
                employees and their families, patients, customers, residents or others. For example, employers may offer
                their employees

                9. YOUR DATA RIGHTS
            </h3>
            <p>
                As you may know, a European Union law called the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) gives
                certain rights to
                applicable individuals in relation to their personal data. Accordingly, we have implemented transparency
                and access
                controls to help such users, including residents of the EU, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom exercise
                those rights.
                As required under applicable law, the rights afforded to you are: A right of access: you have the right
                to obtain (i)
                confirmation as to whether personal data concerning you are processed or not and, if processed, to
                obtain (ii) access to
                such data and a copy thereof. We provide an easy-to-view snapshot of such data via the “My Data” tab in
                the Products.
            </p>
            <p>
                A right to rectification: you have the right to obtain the rectification of any inaccurate personal data
                concerning you.
                You also have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a
                supplementary
                statement.
            </p>
            <p>
                A right to erasure: in some cases, you have the right to obtain the erasure of personal data concerning
                you. Upon
                request, apps2feelgood will permanently and irrevocably anonymize your data such that it can never be
                reconstructed to
                identify you as an individual. However, this is not an absolute right, and apps2feelgood may have legal
                or legitimate
                grounds for keeping such data.
                A right to restriction of processing: in some cases, you have the right to obtain restriction of the
                processing of your
                personal data.
            </p>
            <p>
                A right to data portability: you have the right to receive the personal data concerning you which you
                have provided to
                apps2feelgood, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and you have the right to
                transmit those data
                to another controller without hindrance from apps2feelgood. This right only applies when the processing
                of your personal
                data is based on your consent or on a contract and such processing is carried out by automated means.
            </p>
            <p>
                A right to object to processing: you have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your
                particular
                situation, to processing of personal data concerning you when such processing is based on the legitimate
                interest of
                apps2feelgood. apps2feelgood may, however, invoke compelling legitimate grounds for continued
                processing. When your
                personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to
                the processing of
                such data. You may, in particular, exercise that right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link provided at
                the bottom of
                any messages received, or by managing your privacy preferences by logging in to your apps2feelgood
                account and following
                the instructions.
                A right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority: you have the right to contact the
                supervisory
                authority to complain about apps2feelgood’s personal data protection practices.
            </p>
            <p>
                A right to give instructions concerning the use of your data after your death: as required by applicable
                law, you may
                have the right to give apps2feelgood instructions concerning the use of your personal data after your
                death. To exercise
                one or more of these rights, you can email customer_support@affirmationapps.com. You may access your
                personal data to
                modify or update at any time via an online account, or by emailing customer_support@affirmationapps.com.
                We will respond
                to your request in a reasonable timeframe in accordance with applicable law.

                Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request
                related to your
                personal information. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability
                twice within a
                12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
            </p>
            <p>
                Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we
                collected personal
                information or an authorized representative. Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us
                to properly
                understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
                information if
                we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information
                relates to you. We
                will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s
                identity or
                authority to make the request.

            <p>
                Upon receiving a request for access, portability, or deletion, we will confirm receipt of the request
                within 14 business
                days and provide information about our verification process and how we will process the request.
            </p>
            <p>
                We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If
                we require more
                time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written
                response to the
                email address associated with the account for account holders, and to the email address provided with
                the request
                submission for non-account holders.

                Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer
                request’s receipt. The
                response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For
                data portability
                requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily readable and
                usable.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive,
                repetitive, or
                manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that
                decision and
                provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

                may be attached to your browser in the form of the Facebook Pixel that allows apps2feelgood to deliver

                you on the Facebook platform.
            </p>

            </h3>
            <p>
                We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the
                CCPA, we will not:
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:2rem">
                <span style="font-size:1.7rem ;"> &bull;</span> Deny you goods or services.

                services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or
                imposing penalties.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left:2rem">
                <span style="font-size:1.7rem ;"> &bull;</span> Provide you a different level or quality of goods or

            <p style="margin-left:2rem">
                <span style="font-size:1.7rem ;"> &bull;</span> Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate

            </p>
            <p>
                However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in
                different prices, rates,
                or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your
                personal information’s
                value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a
                financial incentive
                program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
